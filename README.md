#Errors encountered:

1. Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input':

According to the Angular's official documentation, 'Although ngModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default'. This means we need to import the FormsModule in the app.module.ts.

```
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; // <-- NgModel lives here
```
and then add it to our imports:

```
@NgModule({
    imports: [FormsModule]
```

IMPORTANT: every time a change is made to the app.module.ts a complete restart of the Angular app is needed. It won't be automatically applied. You need to kill the process and run 'ng serve' again.

IMPORTANT-II: in my case I also needed to add
```
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```
in the auth.module.ts, as I was reaching this component through the auth-routing.module.

2. Can't bind to 'formGroup' since it isn't a known property of 'form'.

formGroup is a selector for directive named FormGroupDirective that is a part of ReactiveFormsModule, hence the need to import it (in our module). It is used to bind an existing FormGroup to a DOM element.

3. Access to XMLHttpRequest ... has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

I could find the solution to this quite easily with a quick search. The problem lies on the fact that the request to the server is being made from another source different that the one of the server. In this case another localhost port. As explained in this blog post (https://daveceddia.com/access-control-allow-origin-cors-errors-in-angular/), the quickest solution for this is to change the server's configuration to add the header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'. That is, if you have access to the server.

The code to add this header within the Express framework is:

```
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  next();
});
```

4. TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined.
When trying to pass the token through the token service, using the ngx-cookie-library.

5. Uncaught ReferenceError: typing is not defined
    at HTMLInputElement.onchange (chat:19)

I was using the 'onchange' attribute on the input for the chat and getting this error. The reason for it is that in Angular these attributes have a slight different syntax. In short, we need to write them withouth the 'on' before the target event name and then this one inside parentheses. More on that in the official documentation: https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#event-binding.

6. Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:3000/api/chatapp/username/${username}' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field authorization is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.

I was missing 'Authorization' as part of the "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" in my CORS options.

7. CSS not being applied to dynamically created HTML elements.

I was generating li elements in my message.component.ts file to create the chat bubbles. CSS wasn't being reflected. Apparently, this is due to how Angular is rendering files. The workaround to this can be found in this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36265026/angular-2-innerhtml-styling.
In my case, I just needed to add ':host ::ng-deep' before the 'li' selector in my stylesheet file, like this:

```
:host ::ng-deep li {
  ...
}
```

8. "repassword" is not allowed

When trying to sign up a new user I got this error. It was because I was sending 'repassword' as part of the user object, while in the auth controller it wasn't being reflected.
The quick fix for this was deleting this property with the delete operator before calling the auth service.

9. Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'rxjs/Subject' in '/home/ana/chatapp/chat-app/node_modules/ng2-emoji-picker/esm5'

The emoji picker module was built using an older version of rxjs (5.5.2), so this is why I was getting many errors like this one. The solution was simply to install the 'rxjs-compat' package for backwards compatibility.

10. Emojis not being colored in VSCode.

I was using Visual Studio Code as my code editor in its latest version as of February 2019, 1.32, with Ubuntu 16.04 as OS. Still, emojis were being displayed black and white, without colors. To fix this, I installed the Tom Rochette's Emoji extension for VSCode, which includes the Segoe UI Emoji fonts. This fixed it.

11. Emojis not being colored in web browsers (Linux OS).

As I was on Ubuntu, emojis weren't being displayed colored. I had to follow these steps to render the emojis properly on the browser, by installing a new font and adding it to fontconfig: https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font#install-on-linux

Sadly, this solution only works in Firefox, and I couldn't find any solution yet for Chrome. Apparently, in Ubuntu 18.04+ it is as easy as installing the package 'fonts-noto-color-emoji' and restart Chrome. Some day I'll have to upgrade ðŸ˜¢
